# Code-for-Art-Making-in-VR-FA25
All the scripts in this repo are for my Art Making in VR students and anyone who watches my YoutTube tutorials.

NOTES SCRIPT: Create an empty game object called "Notes" and add this script to it. It will create a text box area for you to type things that you want to remember.
