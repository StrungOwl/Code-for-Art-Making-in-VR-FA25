# Code-for-Art-Making-in-VR-FA25
All the scripts in this repo are for my Art Making in VR students and anyone who watches my YoutTube tutorials.

GRAB SCENE TRANSITION: Attach to any game object you want to grab trigger scene transition. Change the "Scene to load" and ensure its spelled the exact same way as your scene is (same spacing and caps too). Need to test to see if the fade works. 

NOTES SCRIPT: Create an empty game object called "Notes" and add this script to it. It will create a text box area for you to type things that you want to remember.
